# PyBer Analysis Using Matplotlib
## Overview and Purpose
PyBer, likely Uber's make-believe competitor, gathered data on trips from drivers across 120 different cities within the United States. This data came from two separate csv files. The information gathered included:
  - Date and time of individual rides
  - Ride identification number
  - City name
  - City type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural)
  - Driver count for each city

The two csv files were merged and subsequently analyzed using Pandas to compare fares between drivers of the three city types.

## Results

As expected, rural areas had the lowest amount of rides and drivers, urban areas had the highest number, and suburban areas were inbetween the two. The notable difference is how much the average fares differ. Rural areas average $34.62 per ride, whereas urban drivers average $24.53 per ride. To summarize the rural data, rural drivers earn:
  - 41.13% more per ride than urban areas
  - 11.79% more per ride than suburban areas
  - 234.89% more than urban drivers
  - 40.48% more than suburban drivers

Rides per driver are as follows:
 - Rural: 1.60
 - Suburban: 1.28
 - Urban: 0.68

Rural drivers had 135.29% more rides per driver than urban drivers, and 25% more than suburban.
